# Web

## Features

- File-based routing, nested layouts, per-route metadata, and automatic code splitting powered by **bini-router**.
- API routes powered by **Hono**:
  - Plain function handlers
  - Full Hono applications
  - Located inside `src/app/api/`
- API execution through:
  - Vite development middleware
  - bini-server in production
  - Edge runtimes when deployed
- Zero-dependency production server (**bini-server**) with:
  - ETag support
  - 304 responses
  - Graceful shutdown
  - Automatic port fallback
- Deploy anywhere:
  - Netlify Edge Functions
